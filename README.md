Example: Imagine that you have to run 100 ns of simulation, but you are running it on an HPC, which sets limited usage times per job (5 days maximum), and you cannot estimate the performance, so send the 100 ns in 5 days, it could result in an error, since it could not be completed, this script divides the simulation into discrete times and automatically resends them, until the entire simulation is completed.

For example in gromacs it is very difficult to create an index to restrict atoms to within 5 A of a given atom, but here this can be done in a simple way, "name CA around 5 of rename LIG", for example.
